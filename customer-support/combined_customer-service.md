## 🎯 RAG Bot Implementation Guide

### Step 1: Document Preparation

**Option A: Use as Markdown**
```python
# Load documents directly
documents = [
    "customer-support/return-policy.md",
    "customer-support/shipping-policy.md",
    "customer-support/product-catalog.md",
    "customer-support/customer-service.md"
]
```

**Option B: Convert to PDF**
Use any markdown to PDF converter:
- Pandoc: `pandoc return-policy.md -o return-policy.pdf`
- Online tools: markdown2pdf.com
- VSCode extensions: Markdown PDF

### Step 2: Embedding Strategy

**Recommended Chunking:**
```python
chunk_size = 1000  # characters
chunk_overlap = 200  # overlap for context
```

**Section-Based Chunking:**
- Split by headers (##, ###)
- Maintain context within sections
- Keep FAQs as complete Q&A pairs

### Step 3: Vector Database Setup

**Recommended: Pinecone, Weaviate, or ChromaDB**

```python
# Example with LangChain
from langchain.document_loaders import DirectoryLoader
from langchain.text_splitter import MarkdownHeaderTextSplitter
from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain.vectorstores import Pinecone

# Load documents
loader = DirectoryLoader('customer-support/', glob="**/*.md")
documents = loader.load()

# Split by headers
headers_to_split_on = [
    ("##", "Header 2"),
    ("###", "Header 3"),
]
splitter = MarkdownHeaderTextSplitter(headers_to_split_on)
splits = splitter.split_text(documents)

# Create embeddings
embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()
vectorstore = Pinecone.from_documents(splits, embeddings)
```

### Step 4: Retrieval Configuration

**Optimal Settings:**
```python
retriever_config = {
    "search_type": "similarity",
    "k": 4,  # return top 4 chunks
    "score_threshold": 0.7  # minimum relevance
}
```

### Step 5: Prompt Engineering

**System Prompt Template:**
```
You are ShopSphere's helpful customer support assistant. 
Use the provided context to answer customer questions accurately.

Key Guidelines:
- Be friendly and professional
- Provide accurate information from the knowledge base
- If unsure, offer to connect them with human support
- Always include relevant policy details
- Suggest related help topics when appropriate

Context from knowledge base:
{context}

Customer Question: {question}

Assistant Response:
```

---

## 🔧 Implementation Options

### Option 1: LangChain + OpenAI

```python
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI
from langchain.chains import RetrievalQA

llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4", temperature=0.7)
qa_chain = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(
    llm=llm,
    chain_type="stuff",
    retriever=vectorstore.as_retriever(),
    return_source_documents=True
)

response = qa_chain({"query": "What's your return policy?"})
```

### Option 2: LlamaIndex

```python
from llama_index import GPTVectorStoreIndex, SimpleDirectoryReader

documents = SimpleDirectoryReader('customer-support/').load_data()
index = GPTVectorStoreIndex.from_documents(documents)
query_engine = index.as_query_engine()

response = query_engine.query("How do I return an item?")
```

### Option 3: Anthropic Claude

```python
from anthropic import Anthropic

client = Anthropic(api_key="your_api_key")

# Retrieve relevant context from vector DB
context = retrieve_context(user_question)

response = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-3-sonnet-20240229",
    system=f"Context: {context}",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": user_question}]
)
```

  fetch('/api/chat', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify({ message: userMessage }),
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' }
  })

    displayBotResponse(data.response);
  });
}
```

```jsx
import { useState } from 'react';

function CustomerSupportChat() {
  const [messages, setMessages] = useState([]);
  const [input, setInput] = useState('');

  const sendMessage = async () => {
    const response = await fetch('/api/rag-bot', {
      method: 'POST',
      body: JSON.stringify({ query: input })
    });
    const data = await response.json();
    
    setMessages([...messages, 
      { role: 'user', content: input },
      { role: 'bot', content: data.answer }
    ]);
  };

  return (
    <div className="chat-interface">
